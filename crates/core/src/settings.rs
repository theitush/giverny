//! Every user-facing option, declared once.
//!
//! Settings screens rot: an option lands in the struct, the UI never learns
//! about it, the docs disagree with both. So the table below is the single
//! declaration, and it generates the commented `config.toml` template, the
//! rows of the settings screen, and the options table in the docs. An option
//! that is not here is not in the app — and the tests prove it, by parsing the
//! generated template back into `Config` and comparing against the defaults.
//!
//! Reading stays with serde (`Config`); this module owns *presentation* and
//! *write-back*. Values are read out of a serialized `Config` by dotted path,
//! so a key that drifts away from the struct fails a test rather than silently
//! showing nothing.
