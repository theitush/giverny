//! How soon terminal output gets a frame.
//!
//! Every frame repaints the whole window, and on a software renderer (WSLg's
//! llvmpipe, where Giverny runs today) that is real CPU: ~12% of a core per
//! frame a second at 1280×820 (#43). A working Claude session redraws its
//! spinner line ~9 times a second whether anyone is looking or not, so
//! drawing every burst the moment it lands cost ~150% of a core for as long
//! as it worked.
//!
//! So output is paced by whether somebody is using the window. Within
//! [`ATTENDED`] of input it is drawn at once — typing, and what the program
//! prints in answer to it, must never wait. Otherwise it waits for the next
//! tick of a shared clock, [`STEP_FOCUSED`] apart while the window has focus
//! and [`STEP_BACKGROUND`] while it does not: a stream still reads as a
//! stream, a spinner still turns, and the frames nobody was going to see are
//! simply not drawn.
//!
//! The same clock drives the app's own glyph animations (the rail's
//! spinners), so a working tab on screen and a spinner in the rail share
//! their frames instead of interleaving two cadences into twice as many.
//!
//! Output from a tab that is not on screen asks for nothing at all past its
//! first byte: the session's dirty flag stays set until the widget draws it,
//! and only its false→true edge wakes the window (see `proxy`).
